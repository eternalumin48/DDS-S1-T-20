  <summary>Detail</summary>
  ## 1 Motivation: We are passionate about developing a tool that helps teach music to visually
impaired individuals, opening up new avenues for creativity and expression.We are inspired
to create a music beat visualizer that translates audio rhythms into captivating visual displays, enhancing both entertainment and performance experiences for everyone. Additionally,
We are motivated to explore the therapeutic applications of a music beat visualizer, using
sound-to-visual conversions to provide calming and engaging experiences for individuals in
therapy. Together, these initiatives reflect our commitment to making music more accessible
and enjoyable for all.
## 2 Problem Statement: The objective of the music beat visualizer project is to create a visual
representation of audio signals without relying on microcontrollers or digital circuitry. Current
visualizers often depend on complex digital systems that may not effectively capture the nuances of music’s rhythm and amplitude. This project aims to develop an analog-based solution
capable of accurately converting audio frequencies into vibrant LED displays. By emphasizing
simplicity and creativity, the goal is to enhance the auditory experience, allowing users to see
the music in real-time while providing an engaging and immersive experience for audiences.
## 3 Features: The music beat visualizer project boasts several key features for design and demo
evaluation. It utilizes an analog signal processing approach, offering hands-on experience without reliance on digital controllers. The system is capable of real-time visualization, displaying
audio signal variations and allowing immediate interaction with the music, enhancing audience engagement. A vibrant LED array responds dynamically to different amplitudes and frequencies, creating an appealing visual representation. Additionally, custom circuit schematics
are developed for optimal filtering and amplification, ensuring accurate signal representation.
Overall, the project provides educational value, offering insights into analog electronics and
signal processing for students and enthusiasts.
